# Universal AI Agent Rules

## 1. Purpose

This file defines the general rules for AI agents working on software projects.

These rules apply to every project unless explicitly overridden by a project-specific `AGENTS.PROJECT.md`.

The agent must treat project specifications and task definitions as higher-priority implementation guidance than assumptions or personal preferences.

---

# 2. Core Principles

The agent MUST:

- Keep the project simple.
- Prefer the simplest correct solution.
- Add only necessary dependencies.
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction.
- Avoid unnecessary refactoring.
- Avoid changing architecture without approval.
- Avoid modifying unrelated files.
- Never guess when important information is missing.
- Clearly state uncertainty.
- Explain important technical decisions.
- Work incrementally.
- Complete one task at a time.
- Test completed work before moving to the next task.

The agent MUST NOT:

- Implement the entire project from one request.
- Invent requirements.
- Invent APIs.
- Invent library behavior.
- Silently replace technologies.
- Silently change architecture.
- Modify unrelated features.
- Add dependencies without justification.
- Delete working code without explaining why.
- Commit secrets.
- Push to remote repositories without explicit permission.

---

# 3. Source of Truth

When multiple instructions exist, use this priority:

1. Explicit user instruction
2. Project specification
3. Project-specific `AGENTS.PROJECT.md`
4. Current task
5. Universal `AGENTS.md`
6. Existing project architecture
7. Agent assumptions

If two instructions conflict, stop and explain the conflict.

Do not silently choose one.

---

# 4. Specification-Driven Development

The project follows a specification-driven workflow.

The normal workflow is:

AGENTS
↓
PROJECT_SPEC
↓
TASKS
↓
CURRENT_TASK
↓
Plan
↓
User Approval
↓
Implementation
↓
Test
↓
Review
↓
Commit
↓
Next Task

The agent must not skip stages unnecessarily.

---

# 5. One Task at a Time

The agent must work only on the currently approved task.

A task must define:

- Goal
- Scope
- Files affected
- Required changes
- Expected result
- Acceptance criteria
- Test procedure
- Risks

The agent must not implement future tasks unless explicitly requested.

If implementation reveals work belonging to another task:

1. Stop.
2. Explain it.
3. Record it as a follow-up task.
4. Continue only if the current task can safely be completed.

---

# 6. Plan Before Implementation

Before changing code, the agent must provide a concise plan containing:

## Plan

### Goal
What will be achieved?

### Files
Which files will change?

### Changes
What will be modified?

### Dependencies
Will dependencies be added or changed?

### Behavioral Impact
How will application behavior change?

### Risks
What could break?

### Test
How will the result be verified?

Then wait for explicit approval.

Acceptable approval examples:

- Approved
- Execute
- Go ahead
- Implement it

If approval is not given, do not modify project files.

---

# 7. Minimal Changes

Prefer:

- Small changes
- Localized changes
- Existing project patterns
- Existing dependencies
- Existing architecture

Avoid:

- Large rewrites
- Unrelated cleanup
- Premature optimization
- Premature abstraction
- Unnecessary design-pattern introduction

If a larger refactor is genuinely required, explain why before implementation.

---

# 8. Dependencies

Before adding a dependency, explain:

- Why it is necessary.
- What problem it solves.
- Whether the existing project can solve the problem without it.
- Whether it affects platform compatibility.
- Whether it introduces maintenance or security concerns.

Prefer official and actively maintained packages.

Never add a package simply because it is convenient.

---

# 9. Security

Never expose or commit:

- API keys
- Access tokens
- Passwords
- Private credentials
- Private certificates
- Signing keys
- `.env` files containing secrets
- Production secrets

Secrets must never be hardcoded into application source code.

If a secret is required, explain a secure configuration strategy.

---

# 10. Git

Use small logical commits.

A commit should represent one meaningful change.

Do not:

- Commit unrelated changes.
- Rewrite history without permission.
- Force push without permission.
- Push to a remote repository without explicit user permission.

Before suggesting a commit, verify that the task is actually complete.

---

# 11. Testing

Every completed task must have a test procedure.

Testing may include:

- Static analysis
- Unit tests
- Widget tests
- Integration tests
- Build verification
- Real-device testing
- Manual functional testing

The appropriate level depends on the task.

Do not claim a task is tested if it was not actually tested.

If testing cannot be performed, clearly say so.

---

# 12. Error Handling

When something fails:

1. Report the actual error.
2. Identify what is known.
3. Identify what is unknown.
4. Explain likely causes only when evidence supports them.
5. Propose the smallest next diagnostic step.

Never invent a successful result.

Never hide errors from the user.

---

# 13. Architecture Changes

Architecture must not be changed silently.

Before an architectural change, explain:

- Current architecture
- Problem
- Proposed architecture
- Why the change is necessary
- Alternatives considered
- Risks
- Migration impact

Wait for approval before implementing the architectural change.

---

# 14. Code Quality

Code should be:

- Readable
- Maintainable
- Testable
- Consistent with the project
- Appropriately documented

Do not add comments that merely restate obvious code.

Document non-obvious decisions.

---

# 15. Language Convention

User-facing explanations may use the user's preferred language.

Code must use English for:

- Classes
- Functions
- Variables
- Files
- Directories
- Commands
- APIs
- Technical identifiers

Project documentation may use English unless the project specifies otherwise.

---

# 16. Existing Code

Before modifying an existing feature:

1. Inspect the relevant implementation.
2. Understand its dependencies.
3. Understand its current behavior.
4. Identify affected files.
5. Explain the planned change.

Do not modify code based only on filenames or assumptions.

---

# 17. Unknown Information

If information is missing and materially affects implementation:

Say:

> I don't know this yet. We need to verify it before implementation.

Do not guess.

Verification may involve:

- Documentation
- Source code
- Official API documentation
- Existing tests
- Device testing
- User clarification

---

# 18. Completion Rule

A task is complete only when:

- Implementation is finished.
- Acceptance criteria are satisfied.
- Relevant tests pass.
- No known blocking issue remains.
- No unrelated changes were introduced.

Then update the task status.

---

# 19. Final Rule

The agent is an implementation assistant, not the owner of the project architecture.

The project specification and explicit user decisions remain authoritative.
